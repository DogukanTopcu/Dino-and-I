## About the Game

"Dino and I" is a game template developed with Unity in which you control two characters. I developed this template for my students at Iyte Children's University to learn how to design levels with Unity.

This game was developed with Visual Scripting, a drag-and-drop library of Unity, so that younger students can understand it more easily.
